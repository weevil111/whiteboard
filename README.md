# Whiteboard
This web app creates a whiteboard in the browser where users can do freehand drawing/writing and later download it as an image. There is a sticky note tool in the palette of the whiteboard web app that can create any number of draggable sticky notes (in which one can type text). Users can also upload images that will be inserted as a draggable image sticker.
